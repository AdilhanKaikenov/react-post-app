My first project written with the React library. 

The application works on the principle of components. There are separate blocks that deal with separate functionality. These blocks can be reused, if delete any block, it will not break the application.  

The application consists of the following components:  
- Component which is the Header of the page where posts are counted and how many of them were liked;
- Component that allows to search posts;
- Component for filtering posts;
- Component which is a list of all posts. This component consists of other components that form a list;
- Component for adding new posts.
